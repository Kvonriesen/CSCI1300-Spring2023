# CSCI1300 Spring 2023
Repository for course content (e.g. homework assignments, project write-ups, recitation exercises) of CSCI 1300 in Spring 2023.

Content will typically be posted in markdown (`.md`) format, though content that's very image-heavy will often be posted as a PDF as well.

# Downloading files
To download single files from Github, navigate to the file, right-click the `Raw` button, and `Save As`. See [this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4604663/download-single-files-from-github) post for more details.

To download the entire repository, navigate to the main [page](https://github.com/CSCI1300-StartingComputing/CSCI1300-Spring2023), select the green *Code* dropdown, and select Download Zip.

# What is Github?
Github is a hosting platform for `git`, which is a ubiquitous version control system (VCS) used for collaborative development and managing versions of files (hence, version control system).

In CSCI 1300, we will not be covering `git` usage directly (though course staff are happy to answer questions about it in office hours!). That said, we want everyone to be familiar with the Github interface.

# What is markdown (`.md`)?
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a **markup language** very commonly used throughout the software industry for technical writing. It is relatively readable in *source* form, but looks even better when *rendered* (for instance, compare the default view of [this readme](https://github.com/CSCI1300-StartingComputing/CSCI1300-Fall2022/blob/main/README.md) on Github to the [raw version](https://github.com/CSCI1300-StartingComputing/CSCI1300-Fall2022/raw/main/README.md)).

Markdown files can easily be viewed in the Github UI. If you'd like to download a write-up, you can do so from the Github UI and open markdown files in VSCode. VSCode has good native [markdown support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)--type `ctrl-shift-v` or `cmd-shift-v` to view a rendered version of your markdown file in VSCode.

We include images in markdown files with *relative links*, which is why there's a separate `images` folder when the markdown file contains images. This is as opposed to binary document formats like `.docx` which include the image in the file itself. Note that to view images in downloaded markdown files, the corresponding images folder will need to be downloaded as well.
